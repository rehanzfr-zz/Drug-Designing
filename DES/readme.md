# Some Intro 
In a recent study (O'Hagan et al., 2015), motivated by the recognition that drugs do, and probably have to, hitchhike on metabolite transporters in order to get into cells. we have used the recent availability of a curated reconstruction of the human metabolic network, Recon2 (Swainston et al., 2013; Thiele et al., 2013), to ask the question as to how similar in structural terms marketed drugs are to the molecules (hereafter “endogenites”) involved in endogenous human metabolism.
t was concluded that while this “does not mean, of course, that a molecule obeying the rule is likely to become a marketed drug for humans, it does mean that a molecule that fails to obey the rule is statistically most unlikely to do so” (O'Hagan et al., 2015), implying that the degree of endogenite-likeness could indeed be a useful chemical filter in drug discovery programmes.
The purpose of the present paper is to develop and provide some of these analyses. It is concluded that drugs are indeed like metabolites when viewed in a variety of orthogonal ways, and that the substructures found within endogenites and marketed drugs provide a novel and useful means of encoding chemical structures in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. 

## Application
We think KNIME node elements for computing the DES encoding(s) provided as supplementary file and copied here can be used for compounds to filter according to DES approach.
